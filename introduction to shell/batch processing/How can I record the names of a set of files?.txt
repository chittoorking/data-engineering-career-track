People often set a variable using a wildcard expression to record a list of filenames. For example, if you define datasets like this:

datasets=seasonal/*.csv
you can display the files' names later using:

for filename in $datasets; do echo $filename; done
This saves typing and makes errors less likely.

If you run these two commands in your home directory, how many lines of output will they print?

files=seasonal/*.csv
for f in $files; do echo $f; done

output:

$ files=seasonal/*.csv$ for f in $files; do echo $f; done
seasonal/autumn.csv
seasonal/spring.csv
seasonal/summer.csv
seasonal/winter.csv
